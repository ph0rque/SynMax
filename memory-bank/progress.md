# Progress

## What works
- Memory Bank initialized.
- PRD drafted in `projectbrief.md` and comprehensive `docs/PRD.md`.
- Private GitHub repo created and synced.
- Agent scaffold in `agent/`:
  - CLI skeleton with dataset autodiscovery and loop.
  - DuckDB executor (`agent/exec/duck.py`).
  - Data profiling tool (`agent/tools/profile.py`).
  - Planner stub (`agent/planner/openai_planner.py`).
  - Reporter/artifacts writer (`agent/report/reporter.py`).
- Tasks tracked in `tasks/prd-tasks.md` with dependencies plan.
- Requirements and run script in place (`requirements.txt`, `scripts/run.sh`).

## What's left to build
- Deterministic planner integration and SQL templates with guardrails.
- Evidence output wiring end-to-end in CLI (include executed SQL).
- Analytics modules: trends, anomalies, correlations, clustering.
- Privacy guardrails (schema/aggregates to LLM only) with logging.
- README examples and polish.

## Current status
- Scaffold complete; moving to planner+executor integration and analytics implementation.

## Known issues/risks
- Performance on very wide tables; ensure projection of only needed columns.
- LLM planning reliability; add guardrails and show executed steps.

## Repo setup
- Initialized local git repo and pushed to private GitHub `ph0rque/SynMax`.
- `.gitignore` excludes `data/`, `.env`, and runs/logs.
