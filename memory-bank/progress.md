# Progress

## What works
- Memory Bank initialized.
- PRD drafted in `projectbrief.md` and comprehensive `docs/PRD.md`.
- Private GitHub repo created and synced.
- Agent scaffold in `agent/`:
  - CLI skeleton with dataset autodiscovery and loop.
  - DuckDB executor (`agent/exec/duck.py`).
  - Data profiling tool (`agent/tools/profile.py`).
  - Planner with tool routing and trend special (`agent/planner/openai_planner.py`, `agent/planner/rule_planner.py`).
  - Reporter/artifacts writer (`agent/report/reporter.py`).
- Tasks tracked in `tasks/prd-tasks.md` with dependencies plan.
- Requirements and run script in place (`requirements.txt`, `scripts/run.sh`).

## What's left to build
- README examples and polish (seasonality, top trending, IQR, sudden shifts, Spearman+p-values, MiniBatch clustering, hypothesis gen).
- Minor planner ambiguity handling and suggestions.

## Current status
- Analytics gap closure implemented; tests green (18 passed). Preparing documentation/examples.

## Known issues/risks
- Performance on very wide tables; ensure projection of only needed columns.
- LLM planning reliability; add guardrails and show executed steps.

## Repo setup
- Initialized local git repo and pushed to private GitHub `ph0rque/SynMax`.
- `.gitignore` excludes `data/`, `.env`, and runs/logs.
