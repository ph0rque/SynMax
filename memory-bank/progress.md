# Progress

## What works
- Memory Bank initialized.
- PRD drafted in `projectbrief.md` based on requirements and 25M-row context.

## What's left to build
- CLI skeleton and configuration.
- Data profiling utilities.
- Deterministic query planner + executor with evidence output.
- Analytics modules (patterns, anomalies, correlations, clustering).
- README examples and polish.

## Current status
- Planning phase complete; ready to scaffold the codebase.

## Known issues/risks
- Performance on very wide tables; ensure projection of only needed columns.
- LLM planning reliability; add guardrails and show executed steps.
